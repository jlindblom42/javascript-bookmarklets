# Javascript Bookmarklets

Collection of javascript bookmarklets for personal use. Feel free to use, modify, or contribute.

To use, copypaste the desired script into a new bookmark.

### [Darken](bookmarklets/darken.js?raw=1)

Adds an overlay to darken the page. Incrementally increases the darkness by 25% with each
activation until it cycles back to the original transparency.

### [Dark Mode](bookmarklets/dark-mode.js?raw=1)

Toggles a simple "dark mode" for the page. Changes the background color, text
color, and link colors to dark mode friendly values.

### [Form Capture](bookmarklets/form-input-bookmarklet-generator.js?raw=1)

Generates another bookmarklet that, when executed, automatically fills in and selects the current values of inputs,
textareas, and select elements on a webpage. Simulates user interactions with change and blur events to ensure that
dynamic forms respond as if a user manually updated each field.

### [Highlight Inputs](bookmarklets/highlight-inputs.js?raw=1)

Highlights input fields on a webpage. Adds green border to fields with values, red for
fields with no value.

### [Invert Images](bookmarklets/invert-images.js?raw=1)

Toggles an inversion filter on all images and SVG elements on a webpage, making them appear in their inverted colors.
